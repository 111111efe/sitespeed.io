We've been working on releasing 1.0 of Browsertime for some time now and we are soon there. There's two things we want to fix first. We want to [change the error handling](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/185) so errors that occur are reflected in the result JSON. And it would be cool to be able [add request headers](https://github.com/sitespeedio/browsertime/issues/155). Let us know if you can help us!
